# ChatGPT Example Prompts



**While ChatGPT is a powerful tool for answering questions and providing explanations, please remember it's an artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI and not a human expert. It's trained on a diverse range of internet text, but it doesn't know everything and may not always provide accurate or complete information.**

If you notice an answer from ChatGPT that doesn't seem right or doesn't make sense, don't hesitate to ask for clarification, double-check the information using other resources, or ask your instructor or peers. It's all part of the learning process! 

Also, keep in mind that as of September 2021, ChatGPT has not been trained with information or updates about technology or programming languages released after this date.

If you want to learn more about the tools and technologies we're using in this assignment, ChatGPT is here to help! Here are some suggested prompts:

# Additional Learning Prompts for Understanding APIs

1. **Investigate other Web Frameworks**: We used Flask for this project. Research another popular web framework, such as Django, and compare it to Flask. What are the key differences and similarities?

2. **Deep Dive into HTTP**: Research more about HTTP methods. How do the other methods, such as PATCH and HEAD, work?

3. **Explore Status Codes**: We've used a few HTTP status codes in this project. Find out about other status codes and their uses.

4. **Extend the API**: Think about other features you could add to this API. How would you implement them? Try adding at least one of these features.

5. **Study Security Measures**: Our API is currently unsecured. Research API security and implement at least one security measure.

6. **Learn about API Documentation**: Look at some examples of good API documentation. Then, write documentation for your Resume API.

7. **Understand Authentication and Authorization**: APIs often require authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data. Understand the difference between these two terms and learn about different strategies (like JWT, OAuth) to implement them.

8. **Implement Pagination**: If our resume had many entries under a particular section (like work history), it might not be practical to return them all at once. Learn about pagination and implement it in one of your API endpoints.

9. **Discover API Testing Tools**: In addition to Pytest, there are other tools like Postman that can be used to test APIs. Learn about one of these tools and use it to test your API.

10. **Use a Database**: Right now, our data is stored in a JSON file. Learn about databases, choose one (like PostgreSQL, MongoDB), and modify your API to use a database for storing data.
